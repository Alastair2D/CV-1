I am a recent university graduate and since finishing my degree I have been learning to code, experimenting in Python, C++, JavaScript and Ruby. I have a keen interest in finance, and how A.I. and machine learning can be used, both in general, and more specifically in this context.

Having just enrolled in Makers Academy, I am hoping to learn the fundamentals of software development, and gain & improve upon the skills required to work in this dynamic industry.

I am looking to work in a forward-thinking, fast-paced environment where I can truly commit & contribute in a meaningful way. I am comfortable with being thrown in at the deep end, and would relish the opportunity to be somewhere where the learning never ends. Additionally, I believe that my creative & driven approach to problem solving, and meticulous attention to detail would be an asset to any company.

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

Having always had a strong interest in Mathematics and investing, my years spent at university studying Economics have allowed me to further my analytical understanding of the world. In addition to this I have been actively investing my savings in the stock market since the age of 18 to positive effect, and this has been brilliant in developing my understanding of risk management and the world of finance in general.

#### Aptitude for Learning

I am incredibly self-motivated with regard to learning about new topics, and take a very methodical approach to doing so, starting with the fundamental concepts to lay a foundation and building up from there. In my spare time, when not socialising with friends, I will typically be reading and learning about new concepts.
