## About Me

I am a recent university graduate and since finishing my degree I have been learning to code, experimenting in Python, C++, JavaScript, Ruby and more recently in Java. I have a keen interest in finance, and how A.I. and machine learning can be used, in general, and more specifically in this context.

Having just enrolled in Makers Academy, I am hoping to learn the fundamentals of software development, and gain & improve upon the skills required to work in this dynamic industry.

I am looking to work in a forward-thinking, fast-paced environment where I can truly commit & contribute in a meaningful way. I am comfortable with being thrown in at the deep end, and would relish the opportunity to be somewhere where there is an emphasis on continuous learning. Additionally, I believe that my creative & driven approach to problem solving, and meticulous attention to detail would be an asset to any company.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (August 2018 - November 2018)

##### Projects from Makers Academy

| Project (Linked to Repo) | Timeframe | Description | Technologies used |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
|[Bank Tech Test] (https://github.com/hjpugh/bank-tech-test-java)| 2 days| This was the project was my first ever experience with Java and was a mock tech test where the intention was to produce high quality, easy to understand, maintainable code. Given the short time-frame, and that I'd never used Java before, I was happy with the end product. |Java, Junit Gradle|


#### University of Leeds (2014 - 2017)
##### BSc Economics (2:1)

- Keen interest in behavioural economics, and how economics can be understood from a psychological perspective.
- With regard to econometrics, I am intrigued by the limits to which this can be used to further understanding. More specifically, how A.I. can be integrated in this field to provide more accurate predictions, by providing a superior understanding of the variables involved.

#### MPW Cambridge
##### A Levels

- Economics - A\*
- Mathematics - A
- Physics - A
- AS Further Mathematics

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

Having always had a strong interest in Mathematics and investing, my years spent at university studying Economics have allowed me to further my analytical understanding of the world. In addition to this I have been actively investing my savings in the stock market since the age of 18 to positive effect, and this has been brilliant in developing my understanding of risk management and the world of finance in general.

#### Aptitude for Learning

I am incredibly self-motivated with regard to learning about new topics, and take a very methodical approach to doing so, starting with the fundamental concepts to lay a foundation and building up from there. In my spare time, when not socialising with friends, I will typically be reading and learning about new concepts.
