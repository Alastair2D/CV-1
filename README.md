## About Me

I am a recent Economics graduate and since finishing my degree I have been learning to code, experimenting in Python, C++, JavaScript, Ruby and more recently in Java. I have a keen interest in finance, and how A.I. and machine learning can be used both in general, and specifically in this context.

I am looking to work in a forward-thinking, fast-paced environment where I can truly commit & contribute in a meaningful way. I am comfortable with being thrown in at the deep end, and would relish the opportunity to be somewhere with an emphasis on continuous learning. Additionally, I believe that my creative & driven approach to problem solving, and meticulous attention to detail would be an asset to any company.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (August 2018 - November 2018)

A 16 week intensive coding course, which includes and emphasises the following:

- OOP, TDD, MVC
- Pair programming, and group work in teams of 4-5
- Agile methodologies
- Extreme programming practices
- Heavy focus on self-lead learning.
- Self reflection, in order to improve processes
- Full-stack web development: Ruby, JavaScript, Java, Rails, React, node.js, RSpec, Jasmine, Junit, Gradle, Enzyme, Capybara, Selenium, jQuery, PostgreSQL etc.

##### Recent Projects

| Project | Timeframe | Description | Technologies Used |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
|[Injection Dependent](https://github.com/Alastair2D/injection_dependent)|< 2 weeks|This was our final group project to tie up the 16 week course done at Maker's Academy. The aim of this app is to help those who have recently been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, by keeping a record of previous injections, and suggesting the next injection site as to get used to cycling around the various sites. This was a particularly interesting project as it was the first time that any of us had worked on a mobile application.|React Native, Expo, Jest, Enzyme|
|[Acebook](https://github.com/hjpugh/acebook-PingPongAlmonds)| 2 weeks| This was the second group project which built on what we had already learnt, the intention being to buid a Facebook clone. It was done using Rails, and this was the first time anyone in the group had used this. Halfway through, we were told to seperate the front & back-end. This ws very useful in teaching the basics of developing a RESTful API, and also allowed me to extend what I had already been doing in React.| Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Devise, JavaScript, React, Jest, Enzyme
|[Makers BnB](https://github.com/hjpugh/makersbnb)| 1 week| This was the first ever group project that any of us had done. The task was to create a platform which emulates the functionality of Air BnB. In addition to being thoroughly enjoyable, it taught us a lot about best practices when it comes to working in a group.| Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec, PostgreSQL, Active Record
|[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/hjpugh/bank-tech-test-java)| 2 days| This was the project was my first ever experience with Java and was a mock tech test where the intention was to produce high quality, easy to understand, maintainable code. Given the short time-frame, and that I'd never used Java before, I am happy with the end product. |Java, Junit Gradle|


#### University of Leeds (2014 - 2017)
##### BSc Economics (2:1)

- Keen interest in behavioural economics, and how economics can be understood from a psychological perspective.

#### MPW Cambridge
##### A Levels

- Economics - A\*
- Mathematics - A
- Physics - A
- AS Further Mathematics

## Skills

#### Analytically Minded

I've always been interested in statistics and investing, my years spent at university studying Economics have allowed me to further my analytical understanding of the world. In addition to this I have been actively investing since the age of 18 to positive effect, and this has been brilliant for developing my understanding of risk management and the world of finance in general.

#### Passion for Learning

I am incredibly self-motivated with regard to learning about new topics, and take a very methodical approach to doing so, starting with the fundamental concepts to lay a foundation and building up from there. My time at Maker's Academy has given me confidence that I can learn any language going forward.
